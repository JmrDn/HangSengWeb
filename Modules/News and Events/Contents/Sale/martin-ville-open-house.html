                <p>Balloons were arranged exquisitely, and people were gathering outside, chattering about random stuff— but probably had something to do with what was in front of their eyes. People are divided, but at some point, they feel united. As I watch from afar, staring at the beauty of socializing; I see cooperation, I see harmony, and I see love. It was something no one could ever pretend— something no one could ever steal. </p>

                <p>It happened on April 11, 2024, when the historical event of Hang Seng Properties took place at Lot 9 Blk 9 F. Aguilar St. Brgy. Pulang Lupa Dos, Las Pinas City, where the luxury haven of the 2-storey townhouse with 3 units is hidden. Oh, how I love to see this world, to be part of these people’s memories.</p>

                <p>People around are enjoying their company, while the staff are blissfully giving food and drinks, and their smiles nearly split their cheeks into two, with sweats and sighs of relief. It was surreal because I heard the noises of a few vehicles outside, I heard negotiations, I heard pure conversations— but I felt a sense of tranquility within. I felt comforted and the nostalgic effect hit me differently. </p>
