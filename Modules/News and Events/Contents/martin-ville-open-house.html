                <p>Balloons were arranged exquisitely, and people were gathering outside, chattering about random stuff— but probably had something to do with what was in front of their eyes. People are divided, but at some point, they feel united. As I watch from afar, staring at the beauty of socializing; I see cooperation, I see harmony, and I see love. It was something no one could ever pretend— something no one could ever steal. </p>

                <p>It happened on April 11, 2024, when the historical event of Hang Seng Properties took place at Lot 9 Blk 9 F. Aguilar St. Brgy. Pulang Lupa Dos, Las Pinas City, where the luxury haven of the 2-storey townhouse with 3 units is hidden. Oh, how I love to see this world, to be part of these people’s memories.</p>

                <p>People around are enjoying their company, while the staff are blissfully giving food and drinks, and their smiles nearly split their cheeks into two, with sweats and sighs of relief. It was surreal because I heard the noises of a few vehicles outside, I heard negotiations, I heard pure conversations— but I felt a sense of tranquility within. I felt comforted and the nostalgic effect hit me differently. </p>

                <p>The founder is at the top of the ladder of success, wearing his natural blue eyes and comfortable jorts, but he humbly communicates with the attendees of the Open House. He is adored because of his alluring stares and poise, his enticing breath and jaw-dropping smiles, and his mesmerizing and enticing accent— it captured the attention of attendees instead of the townhouse. </p>

                <p>I thought he was the most compelling in the event until the director called his team to steal the moment to remember, wearing blue shirts with the same prints, “Hang Seng.” He inexplicably amazes me with how he takes into account the construction workers, even introducing them into the crowd. The “main character,” that’s how he considers the boots on the ground.</p>

                <p>As I swayed in the breeze, another thing stole my attention. The youngsters are around, snapping some moments while it endures. Each of them carries a handheld device, but the tension is evident in their eyes. A beautiful lady came into the picture. She was dressed in green, and dazzling my skin with her shimmering flip-flops. When she smiles, the youngsters sigh in relief. Maybe thinking— finally, we made it!  </p>

                <p>As I sat in my pot, surrounded by flyers and cintraboard, I felt the natural meaning of living, I found the meaning of life. As a living thing, I know you’ll love it here. It was a splendid memory, and then I realized, this is where I want to spend the rest of my life. What have they done to me? I’m just a plant.</p>
